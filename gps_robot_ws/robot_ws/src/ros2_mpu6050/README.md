# MPU6050 - For Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2)

## Overview

This repository contains the MPU6050 package dedicated for ROS2. It contains the driver and node to allow integration with [sensor_msgs/msg/Imu Message](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/sensor_msgs/msg/Imu.html)

## Hardware

This package has been tested with the following hardwares: \

Raspberry Pi 4B, 4GB RAM. \
MPU6050 sensor breakout board used: https://components101.com/sensors/mpu6050-module \
The Raspberry Pi 4B runs this image: https://github.com/ros-realtime/ros-realtime-rpi4-image

### Preferred Environment Setup

To run this example without issues, the following environment setup are preferred.

|                  |                          |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Operating System | ros-realtime-rpi4-image  |
| ROS2 Version     | ROS2 Humble              |

### Package Integration

**Just clone this repository on your ros2 workspace/src.

### Sensor Calibration

The following steps provides detailed info to calibrate the sensor if necessary:

1. Build the package
```bash
colcon build --packages-select ros2_mpu6050
```
2. RPi to MPU6050 I2C wiring 
3. Place the sensor in a surface perpendicular to the direction of the gravitational acceleration. (**This is important)
4. Run the following command
```bash
ros2 run ros2_mpu6050 ros2_mpu6050_calibrate
```
5. The values of the offsets should be displayed
```bash
I2c communication started. .
MPU6050 initialization successful

**** Starting calibration ****
Ensure that the mpu6050 board is positioned in a surface perpendicular to the direction gravitational accelleration
This may take a while depending upon the no of samples, please wait. . .


In the params.yaml file under config directory, copy the following results accordingly

Gyroscope Offsets: 
gyro_x_offset --> -1.44153
gyro_y_offset --> 0.596412
gyro_z_offset --> 0.618626

Accelerometer Offsets: 
accel_x_offset --> 10.601
accel_y_offset --> -0.424632
accel_z_offset --> -3.21498
```
6. Copy these values in the params.yaml file under config directory of the package replacing the 0 values
```bash
# [deg/s]
gyro_x_offset: 0.0
gyro_y_offset: 0.0
gyro_z_offset: 0.0
# [m/sÂ²]
accel_x_offset: 0.0
accel_y_offset: 0.0
accel_z_offset: 0.0
```

## Starting the ros2_mpu6050 node

Build the package
```bash
colcon build --packages-select ros2_mpu6050
```
and execute the following command.

```bash
ros2 launch ros2_mpu6050 ros2_mpu6050.launch.py
```
Build specific package

```bash
colcon build --packages-select `name_of_package`
```

## Listening to the IMU topic

After launching ros2_mpu6050.launch.py,

In the host PC or in the RPi SSH client terminal, does not matter, execute the following command

```bash
ros2 topic echo /imu/mpu6050
```

If the above command does not work, ensure that the /imu/mpu6050 topic shows when running the following command

```bash
ros2 topic list
```
